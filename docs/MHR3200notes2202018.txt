if the only thing keeping your employee is how much money there is, you're going to lose your employees. because some other richer company is going to throw more money at them.
intangibles

organizations must thing about what type of behavior are you trying to incentivize
this is why total rewards is important

LTI - long term incentives
	e.g. stock options, strike price, strike date
		strike price could be 50, and market price on your strike date could be 75, which would be great for you
	what happens if upside down?
		well you wouldn't exercise it.

	there's also an expiration period

	leadership of company wouldn't want all employees to exercise at once, which would imply that the company sucks bc everyone is selling

on the folly of rewarding A, while hoping for B . .. rats, monkeys, or human beings. 
what gets rewarded gets done

active v passive enrollment
	amazon does passive after a year, active was first time
