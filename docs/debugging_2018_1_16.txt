when i do import Vue from 'vue' in store.ts, Vue loads fine in webpack/web  . . .. but not in ava-ts tests . . .

-----





DONE get knawledgeMap DI working
DONE check if knawledemap mounting can work
GOAL get treecomponent official mounting working so we can test with props



studyMenu spec test with a method doesn't work. this is probably because there is a vue warning stating template or render function not defined....
	. . . . but we get that same warning on knawledgeMap2.spec.ts . . . where a test with a method DOES work

[1] lets try cloning knawledgemap into a different folder and running the same spec.
	-- so it worked
	-- then i replaced its innards with study menus
	-- still worked

[2] lets replace knawledgemapclone's innards with treeComponents innards
	-- works great!
[3] lets slowly rename everything from knawledgemapclone to treeComponet. . .. tree3Component haha?
