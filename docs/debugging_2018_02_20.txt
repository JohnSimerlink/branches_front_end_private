loaders must come before storesSingletons


canvas UI must be loaded before storeSingletons container
currently canvasUI is in rendering . .. so that would imply rendering must be loaded before storeSingletons container

ACTION - so we just switched the order of loadDataObjects and loadRendering

now loadStoreSingletons needs a binding for AUtoSaveMutableSubscribableTreeStoreArgs bound beforehand. we currently have that in loaders. which right now is after storeSingletons. . ..  let's put it in stores.

setProficiency
will also calculate lastRecordedStrength
or better yet lastStrength, and lastMeasurement time
when a contentUseritem is either loaded or when setProficiency is called . . . we register a setTimeout function that sets overdue equal to true
