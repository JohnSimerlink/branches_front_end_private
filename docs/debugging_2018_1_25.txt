ObjectFirebaseAutoSaver is used in ContentUserLoaderAndAutoSaver, AutoSaveMutableSubscribableContentUserStore

-when a new contentUser item is created how does it get saved? How does the interaction with contentUserLoaderAndAutoSaver work?

scenario 2
so a content is received by sigmaNodesUpdater
But no tree is received yet that has that contentId
	so we temporarily store that content in contentIdContentMap

So when a tree(s) is received that has the contentId it will check the contentIdContentMap[contentId] and automatically call receiveNewContent with that content value

app integration 4
-we need to mak eit so that we can just swap out the firebaseTrees ref, swap out the store.ts injection, fetch the appContainer. . . run appContainer.start(), then run store.commit(MUTATION_NAMES.CHANGE_PARENT_ID, {parentTreeId, childTreeid}) and see that the spy gets called on the appropriate child ref

--so intermediate step is get it so that bootstrap.ts simply just fetches appContainer, then calls appContainer.start()

firebaseContentRef is injected into
	-ContentLoader as the firebaseRef property
	-ContentLoader and AutoSaver as the firebaseRef property
	-AutoSaveMutableSubscribableContentStore as the contentFirebaseRef propertys
