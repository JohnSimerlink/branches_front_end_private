ObjectFirebaseAutoSaver is used in ContentUserLoaderAndAutoSaver, AutoSaveMutableSubscribableContentUserStore


-when a new contentUser item is created how does it get saved? How does the interaction with contentUserLoaderAndAutoSaver work?






scenario 2
so a content is received by sigmaNodesUpdater
But no tree is received yet that has that contentId
	so we temporarily store that content in contentIdContentMap

So when a tree(s) is received that has the contentId it will check the contentIdContentMap[contentId] and automatically call receiveNewContent with that content value
