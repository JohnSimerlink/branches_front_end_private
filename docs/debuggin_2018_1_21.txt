what are all the things a load could be triggered from

sigmaNodeLoader
	-will call the 5 loaders related to that treeId
a list of sigmanodes to load from cache
	-which may or may not be in the same map
	-from a user action
		-user just hovered over a parent (either by mouse, or by placing in center of screen) . . .and thus children should load
	
	-immediately after that user created a node - or someone else created a child node of a parent node that the user has loaded 
	-if already loaded, it will not attempt to load again
		-make sure child loaders have same behavior


now the other objects have already started subscribing (via appContainer.js . .. so calling sigmaNodeLoader.load(treeId) or sigmaNodeLoader.loadAndLoadChildren(treeId) will have the items appear on the map (but maybe we hsould have the .startListening to store or store/source changes be a function of sigmaNodeLoader and not other objects)
