System to determine where to add the child by default

NewChildLocationDeterminer
	+DetermineLocation(treeId)

NewChildLocationCalculator
	+calculateLocation(currentChildLocations, parentLocation, allLocations)


need to get all the nodes in a certain rectangle around the node . .. and then we can just call the determineNewLocation method
	- this only gets called everytime we call the determineNewLocation method.
	- to do this loop through all the nodes, calculating the distance from each node to the parent node, and appending it to the result list if greater than some distance


for entire 


give every node a hilbert number calculated from x and y

goal - a method to get all nodes within a radius of r (in our case 20) of a certain coordinate.

so the store calls
so something calls something which has a reference to sigmaInstance. this allows us to get all the nodes within a certain distance from hte parent node.

then with that list of obstacleNodes, we pass it in into the pure function getNewLocation


----7pm-----
currently treeLocation is not being created in db.
also treeLocation is not being added to the new sigmanode that was just created



2pm saturday 
--- color change doesn't work on things already loaded
--- when creating a new category node, need to make obstacle radii much larger, and circle of preference on parent Node larger too

change linear descent to expontential descent

spacing algorithm doesn't always even seem to get called
