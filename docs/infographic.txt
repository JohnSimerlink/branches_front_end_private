HOW TO LEARN MORE IN LESS TIME

TIP 1: Quiz yourself, don't re-read 

Rereading textbooks is one of the slowest ways to learn.

It is easy. And it tricks you into thinking that you know more than you do.

Being able to recognize information is not the same as being able to recall information.

To learn faster, you have to actively quiz yourself.

TIP 2: Space out your studying, don't cram.
If you study something 15 minutes now, 15 minutes tomorrow, 15 minutes a week later, and 15 minutes a month later - you'll remember it a lot longer, than if you were than if you were to study it for one hour all at once.

We all know these two tips. [ mini infographic on right with the 3-chart]. But we rarely follow them.

This is because the school system doesn't give us the correct tools. Universities charge us $10,000 - or more - a year and they literally give us the worst possible ways to learn and retain information - textbooks and powerpoints.

That's why I made Branches.

With one glance Branches shows you how much you know and how much you don't know.

It also ensures that the only way you can study is by quizzing yourself. This speeds up your learning.

It notifies you the next time you need to review something. This ensures that you space out your studying, rather than cramming.

If you study with the correct techniques you can learn 2x more in the same amount of time as people who study with the wrong techniques.

Now imagine you could save just 2 hours a week of studying
	- You could use that time getting more sleep
	- Or you could spend more time with your significant other and family members
	- If you have a job paying $10/hr, you could earn an extra $20/week, or $80 a month.

For just $9/mo you can boost your grades by studying with Branches.
